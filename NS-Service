1. Core Components
a) Go Scanner (scanner.go)

    Efficient SYN and TCP connect scanning

    Handles IPv4 (IPv6 support can be added)

    Reports open ports with service names

    Output format is consistent for parsing by GUI or CLI

    Handles max port limit and target resolution

    Compiled as scanner binary

b) Python CLI Scanner (ngsp.py)

    Wrapper around Go scanner or own Python scanning logic

    Parses args: target, max ports

    Outputs scan results with clear [OPEN] Port N lines

    Used for CLI-only mode or fallback

    Produces JSON and text reports

c) Python GUI (gui_nightscope.py)

    Tkinter GUI with input fields: target, max port

    Radio buttons to select CLI or GUI mode

    Runs Go scanner subprocess or Python CLI scanner subprocess

    Captures live output, parses open ports, shows detailed output & summary

    Save results button outputs text and JSON reports

    Real-time progress indicator

    Error handling and user-friendly dialogs

3. Coding Best Practices & Features Modeled

    Logging: add optional debug logs (can extend)

    Argument parsing: CLI with argparse in Python CLI scanner

    Error handling: proper exceptions and user feedback

    Thread safety: GUI scanning runs in a background thread

    ANSI escape sequence cleanup: GUI output parsing

    Extensible port-service mapping: dictionary with common ports

    Configurable scanning options: max port, target, mode

    Save & export results: to both text and JSON formats

    Clear UI feedback: progress bar, enabling/disabling buttons

    Cross-platform terminal launching (where applicable)

    Clear code separation between GUI, CLI, and Go scanner

4. Example README.md Outline (for final project)

# NightScope

NightScope is a stealthy, multi-language port scanner designed with performance, accuracy, and usability in mind. It combines a fast Go-based SYN scanner with a Python CLI and GUI interface for versatile usage.

## Features

- SYN and TCP connect scanning with service mapping
- Scan up to 65535 ports quickly
- User-friendly GUI with real-time output and progress
- CLI mode for terminal-based scanning
- Save scan results to text and JSON files
- Multi-threaded scanning for responsive GUI
- Easily extensible and customizable

## Setup

1. Build Go scanner:

cd go_scanner
go build -o scanner scanner.go


2. Ensure Python dependencies are installed (tkinter, etc.)

3. Run GUI:

python3 gui_interface/gui_nightscope.py


4. Or run CLI scanner:

python3 cli_interface/ngsp.py --scan example.com --max 1000


## Usage

- Enter target IP/domain in GUI
- Select max port (default 1000)
- Choose GUI or CLI mode
- Click Start Scan
- View live results and summary
- Save results for reporting

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute with new scanning techniques, protocol support, 
or GUI improvements!

5. Next Steps for You

    Make sure your Go scanner is efficient and stable

    Test Python CLI scanner independently (add argparse if missing)

    Test GUI thoroughly for real-time parsing and UI responsiveness

    Write README.md and setup instructions

    Package your project (zip or GitHub repo) for easy sharing or deployment

If you want, I can help:

    Review/refactor your Go scanner for speed/accuracy

    Add argparse and enhanced reporting to Python CLI scanner

    Polish GUI code with modular class structure and comments

    Generate full README.md with instructions, screenshots, and examples

    Create a basic test suite or CI pipeline for your project
