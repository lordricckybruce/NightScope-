 NightScope

NightScope is a fast, stealthy port scanner project integrating 
a high-performance Go backend scanner with a Python GUI frontend.
I used Go language for its backend scanning due  
1. High performance and speed scanning due to it's efficient concurrency support
   allowing scanner to send and handle thousands of network packets with heavy resource usage.
2. Reduced Detection Risks due to it's speed with raw socket allow the scanner 
   to send SYN packets stealthily, helping to by pass or reduce detection by firewalss, ips or dis systems
Summary:
while go handles intensive stealthy network scanning effieciently 
python offers a flexible, user friendly interface with powerful UI libraries and resources
